## Problem Statement

Retail businesses often rely on discounting strategies to increase sales volume; however, excessive or poorly planned discounting can negatively impact overall profitability. This project aims to analyze Superstore sales data to understand key sales and profitability drivers and evaluate the effectiveness of discount strategies over time.

The key objectives of this analysis are:
- To analyze overall sales and profit performance across multiple years.
- To evaluate the impact of different discount levels on profitability.
- To identify loss-making discount strategies that erode profit margins.
- To understand sales contribution by customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
- To analyze monthly sales trends and seasonality for better planning and forecasting.
- To provide data-driven insights that support effective pricing and business decisions using Power BI visualizations.
